      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Mohammed Al Otmi is a Ph.D. candidate in Chemical Engineering at the University of Florida, where he integrates molecular modeling, polymer physics, and machine learning to design next-generation membranes for energy and separation applications. As a researcher in the Department of Energy (DOE)-funded Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC), he has led projects on anion exchange membranes for fuel cells, developing innovative computational approaches to screen polymer candidates with enhanced conductivity and stability. Mohammed earned his undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from Mississippi State University. Before joining Dr. Sampath’s group, he worked as a Product Quality Engineer at Delta Protein International. He is passionate about renewable energy, sustainable separation technologies, material modeling, and informatics.
